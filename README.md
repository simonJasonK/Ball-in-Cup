# Ball-in-Cup
Source code for Ball in Cup, released on the App Store in August 2016

This repository hosts the code from the live App Store release, for educational
purposes; while you may try to run it from Xcode, I make no warranties as to 
its functionality on your specific machine; go to jajse.com/ballincup if you
wish to play. :-)

* Support for iOS 8.x has been phased out
